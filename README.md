# Fullstack Features 全栈开发核心功能与技术

## 📚 A collection of language agnostic core fullstack features for almost every application

When I first began learning to code, I often hear people tell me to learn xxx technology, as if it's a magic pill. But no, there is no magic pill, there's also not a single language or framework that allows you to get a job in the field if you only grasp the basics of it.

Users don't give a sh-t whether your app uses `Redux` or `Zustand` for state management, `REST` or `GraphQL` for APIs, nor do they care about which buttons you clicked in `AWS` console to deploy your infrastructure. All they care about, is whether your software is solving the problem(s) you promised them it'll solve.

So, why does it have anything to do with fullstack features?

Well, your code, your infrastructures and your databases are all built FOR EACH OTHER, they're rather useless on their own.

Reading documentations and making toy projects alone doesn't teach you as much. The concepts of `refetchQueries` and `Reactive Variables` in Apollo GraphQL were jibberish to me until I had to save AWS bills by reducing duplicated API queries using `InMemoryCache`.

I could list out a ton lot more examples of how I learnt things, and I can be 100% sure with you that none of them came from following YT tutorials or reading documentations alone.

Most applications (in web 2 at least) are essentially fancy spreadsheets doing CRUD operations on the cloud. Different languages and frameworks simply do things in different ways, and some companies prefer certain frameworks over others, but the underlying core features remain the same: fancy CRUD operations.

Below is a list of features that almost every application has, which we, as people trying to learn to code better be aware of during our learning process
